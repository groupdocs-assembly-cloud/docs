This section provides a general marketing information on Assembly Cloud evaluation and pricing strategies.

## Evaluation with Free Trial Plan

You get access to all the features of Assembly Cloud using a [Free Trial Plan](https://purchase.groupdocs.cloud/trial) with monthly data processing limit. This plan is automatically granted when you [sign up for a new account](https://docs.groupdocs.cloud/total/creating-and-managing-account/). It is intended to give you a good understanding of the service's capabilities and also lets you try some software development.

For production use and greater scale start with a [Paid Plan](https://purchase.groupdocs.cloud/pricing), which has no limitations.
